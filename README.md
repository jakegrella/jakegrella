I'm a 23 year old full stack web engineer. I'm currently working @ [Northwestern Mutual](https://northwesternmutual.com/) to help people live the life they want through financial security. I enjoy real estate, architecture, and photography, and I am slowly working on projects related to these passions through [headed westtt](https://headedwesttt.com). If you'd like to get in touch you can DM me on Twitter at [@jakegrella](https://twitter.com/jakegrella), email me at [jake@jakegrella.com](jake@jakegrella.com), or message me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jakegrella).
